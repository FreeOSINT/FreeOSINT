# FreeOSINT.org — Open Source Intelligence for Everyone

Welcome to the official GitHub repository powering [FreeOSINT.org](https://FreeOSINT.org), a **100% free, ad-free, and open-access** platform dedicated to teaching and sharing **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** techniques.

## 🧭 Mission & Philosophy

**FreeOSINT.org** was created and is maintained by **B**, a long-time advocate for **freedom of information**, **digital empowerment**, and **individual safety through knowledge**. This site and all of its materials are built on the foundational belief that powerful investigative skills and tools should not be locked behind paywalls, corporate control, or gatekeeping.

> “Information is power. When you give people the tools to see the world more clearly, you make them safer, stronger, and freer.” — B

FreeOSINT.org exists to *democratize access* to these tools, equipping individuals, activists, journalists, and researchers with the ability to conduct ethical, informed investigations using only open sources.
